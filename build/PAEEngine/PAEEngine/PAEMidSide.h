/** Convert mid-side to left-right or vice versa.
 This converts pairs of channels in the source to mid-side or left-right. If the
 input pairs are mid-side then the output will be left-right pairs. If the input pairs
 are left-right then the output will be mid-side pairs. This is becasue the conversion
 in either direction is the same. */
